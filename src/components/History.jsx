      <h1>History of the District</h1>
     <p> To begin with, Coimbatore was in two parts for purposes of revenue
      administration. In 1804, the areas were merged into one and brought under
      one District Collector.During that time, Mr.H.S.GREAME,[I/C] from
      20/10/1803 to 20/01/1805 was the Collector, Coimbatore District. In 1868,
      the Nilgiris District was bifurcated from the Coimbatore District. At the
      opening of the present century there were ten taluks in the district viz.,
      Bhavani, Coimbatore, Dharapuram, Erode, Karur, Kollegal, Palladam,
      Pollachi, Satyamangalam and Udumalaipettai.</p>  <p>Originally Coimbatore district
      formed part of the Kongu country, the history of which dates back to the
      Sangam age. It is found that in early days the area was inhabited by
      tribes, the most predominant among them being the Kosars who are reported
      to have had their headquarters at Kosampathur which probably later became
      the present Coimbatore. However, tribal predominance did not last long as
      they were over-run by the Rashtra Kutas. From Rashtrakutas the region fell
      into the hands of the Cholas who were in prominence at the time of Raja
      Raja Chola. On the decline of Cholas the Kongu territory was occupied by
      the Chalukyas and then by the Pandyas and the cysalas. Due to internal
      strife in the Pandyan kingdom the Muslim rulers from Delhi happened to
      interfere. Thus the area fell into the hands of Madurai Sultanate from
      whom the Vijayanagar rulers wrestled for the region during 1377-78 after
      overthrowing the Madurai Sultanate. For a few years the area remained
      under independent control of Madurai Nayaks.</p> <p>During the period of Muthu
      Veerappa Nayak and later during the period of Tirumal Nayak internal
      strife and intermittent wars ruined the kingdom. As a consequence during
      the period of Tirumal Nayak, the Kongu region fell into the hands of the
      Mysore rulers from whom hyder Ali took over the area. However, consequent
      on the fall of Tippu Sultan of Mysore in 1799, the Kongu region came to be
      ceded to the East India Company by the Maharaja of Mysore who was restored
      to power by the East India Company after defeating Tippu Sultan. From then
      till 1947 when India attained Independence, the region remained under
      British control who initiated systematic revenue administration in the
      area. </p>  <p>The Avinashi taluk was formed in the same year when Karur taluk
      wastransferred to Tiruchirappalli district. In 1927, some villages of
      Bhavani taluk together with a few villages from Salem district were
      constituted into Mettur Area but very soon in 1929, this area was
      transferred to Salem district. Again in the year 1956 considerable area of
      the district, viz., the whole of Kollegal taluk was transferred to Mysore
      State as part of the States Re-organisation Scheme.In 1975, Satyamangalam
      sub-taluk was upgraded as a full fledged taluk. Again in 1979, Perundurai
      sub-taluk of Erode taluk and Mettuppalaiyam sub-taluk of Avanashi were
      also upgraded into independent taluks. Thus the total number of taluks in
      the district came to twelve. This, however, did not last long. In the same
      year of 1979, six taluks were bifurcated from the district to constitute a
      new district called Erode District. Under G.O. Ms. No. 1917 Revenue dt.
      31-8-1979, Government of Tamil Nadu the following six taluks were
      bifurcated from the then Coimbatore district to form a new Erode district.
      Bhavani, Gopichettipalaiyam, Satyamangalam, Erode, Perundurai and
      Dharapuram taluks went with the new Erode District that time Coimbatore
      District contains only nine taluks before bifurication of Tiruppur as a
      seperate newDistrict viz. Coimbatore(South), Coimbatore(North),
      Mettupalayam, Avanashi, Palladam,Tirupur, Pollachi, Udumalpettai and
      Valparai. As per G.O.Ms. No. 617, 618 Revenue dt 24.10.2008, Government of
      Tamil Nadu the four taluks from Coimbatore District (i.e. Tiruppur,
      Udumalpet, Palladam and Avinashi(Part)) and three taluks from the Erode
      district (i.e.Dharapuram, Kangeyam and Perundurai (Part)) were bifurcated
      and formed another new District called Tiruppur District. This bifurcation
      considerably reduced the size of the Coimbatore District during that time
      Coimbatore District has only two revenue sub divisions of Coimbatore and
      Pollachi and contains eight taluks namely Coimbatore(North),
      Coimbatore(South), Mettupalayam, Annur, Sulur, Kinathukadavu, Pollachi and
      Valparai.On 12-02-2014 Coimbatore (South) taluk was bifurcated in to three
      taluks and formed two new separate taluks of Madukkarai and Perur taluks.A
      new third Revenue Sub Division was formed by bifurcated fom the old
      Coimbatore Revenue Sub Divison called Coimbatore North Revenue Sub Divison
      and Coimbatore South Revenue Sub Divison. Now Coimbatore District
      contatins three Revenue Sub Divisions of Coimbatore (South), Coimbatore
      (North) and Pollachi Sub Divisions. As per the latest G.O. No. 419, Dated:
      25-10-2018 by the Department of Revenue and Disaster Management a new
      taluk of Anaimalai was created by bifurcating Pollachi taluk which was one
      of the biggest taluk in the District and new Anaimalai taluk comes under
      Pollachi Sub Division. At present in Coimbatore District contains eleven
      taluks of Coimbatore (South), Coimbatore (North), Perur, Madukkarai,
      Annur, Mettupalayam, Sulur, Pollachi, Kinathukadavu, Anaimalai and
      Valparai revenue taulks.</p>
